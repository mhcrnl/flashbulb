In flashbulb-card.c:
	*) Possibly make FlashbulbCardXmlParseData a class
	*) Possibly make the XML parser more modular:
		- separate parsing from card construction
		- provide functions to get the names of the elements
		- while we're add it, develop separate functions to
		  verify elements
	*) Set errors if the document has unrecognized elements?
